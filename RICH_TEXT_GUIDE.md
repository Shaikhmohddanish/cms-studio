# Rich Text Editor Guide

## Formatting Text

The rich text editor in this Sanity Studio has been configured to support various formatting options:

### Basic Text Formatting

- **Bold Text**: Select text and click the "B" button or use Ctrl+B (Cmd+B on Mac)
- *Italic Text*: Select text and click the "I" button or use Ctrl+I (Cmd+I on Mac)
- Underlined Text: Select text and click the "U" button
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Select text and click the strikethrough button

### Line Breaks

There are multiple ways to create line breaks:

1. **Single Line Break**: Press Shift+Enter to create a single line break
2. **Paragraph Break**: Press Enter to create a new paragraph
3. **Custom Line Break**: Use the "Insert" menu to add a custom Line Break object
   - Choose "Single Break" or "Double Break" depending on your needs

### Links

To add links to your content:

1. Select the text you want to turn into a link
2. Click the link button in the toolbar
3. Enter the URL in the dialog that appears
4. Toggle "Open in new tab" if needed

### Headings and Lists

- Use the format menu to select different heading styles (H1, H2, H3, H4)
- Use the list buttons to create bulleted or numbered lists

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If your formatting isn't appearing correctly:

1. **Bold or Italic Not Working**: Make sure you're using the toolbar buttons rather than markdown syntax
2. **Line Breaks Not Working**: Use Shift+Enter for a single line break or add a custom Line Break object
3. **Multiple Line Breaks**: Use the custom Line Break with "Double Break" style
